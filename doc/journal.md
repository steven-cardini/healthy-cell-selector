# Plan for upcoming Weeks

## Week 11
- Add path features to the currently available cell feature set
- Build new decision trees, taking into account path features
- Work on scatter plots, color according to decision trees and compare it to previous plots

## Week 12
- Finish decision tree approach
- Start with Naive Bayesian approach
