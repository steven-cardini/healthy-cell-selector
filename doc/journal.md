# Plan for upcoming Weeks

## Week 10
- Continue getting familiar with R relevant packages
- Work on scatter plot of healthy cells
- Get familiar with package(s) for building decision trees in R

## Week 11
- Add path features to the currently available cell feature set
- Build new decision trees, taking into account path features
- Color the scatter plot according to decision trees and compare it to previous plots
