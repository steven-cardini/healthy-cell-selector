# Plan for upcoming Weeks

## Week 13
- Evaluate decision trees based on other data sets
- Analyze whether to continue with Naive Bayesian, logistic regression (lm()), or other approach

## Week 14
- Dig into new approach (Naive Bayesian, ...)

# Project Journal

## 23.03.2017
14:00 - 17:30
- Modified rpart decision trees to split based on Gini vs. Information

- Added confusion matrices for decision trees and plots for data sets according to decision trees

## 17.03.2017
17:00 - 19:00

## 23.02.2017
13:00 - 18:00
- Introduction to data formats and microscopy images with M. Dobrzynski
